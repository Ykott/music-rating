The use should be able to look at the following things:

1. Leaderboard, they see the list of thier top songs. ie most votes to least votes.
    - They should have a personal ranking
    - There should be the ability to have some general pool (maybe by genre) and people can vote there onto a public leaderboard.
2. Add and Remove songs. This will add or remove the song from the pool.
    - add Oldman
    - remove Harvest Moon
3. Vote, they will be presented with 2 songs (idealy they would be able to listen to both of them) and then they will vote on this. 
    - We can ensure everthing gets a good number of votes by a "ticket" system, where we likelyhood of a song being chosen is like (max(all songs) - # apperances / total number of tickets) for this one. 


    Advanced Features:
    - import playlist / library from spotify and use that as the voting pool
